For this project I did utilize AI, however I did so in a manor that would help me rather than simply give me the answer. Most of what the AI served to do was help me with syntax since it is a bit different in react than vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. The one place I did use it a bit more was stylistic elements, which actually helped me a lot from an accessibility standpoint. Since I'm colorblind, I would not have been able to (easily) select as good of background colors as I was provided by AI. All in all, this was not just some vibe coded website (in fact gemini was not able to implement itself correctly when I thought the java boilerplate code from the documentation needed significant revision, rather than being able to pretty much copy/paste it in).
